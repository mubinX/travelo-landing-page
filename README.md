# Travelo
A basic "CSS Flexbox" landing page for a travel website. In order to feel more at ease with the "CSS Flexbox" property, I created this page. This page is not yet responsive on mobile devices.

This website's pictures are all from https://www.pexels.com.
I used "Canva" to design the logo. :D
